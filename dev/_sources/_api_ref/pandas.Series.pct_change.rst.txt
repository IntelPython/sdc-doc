pandas.Series.pct_change
************************

Percentage change between the current and a prior element.

Computes the percentage change from the immediately previous row by
default. This is useful in comparing the percentage of change in a time
series of elements.

:param periods:
    int, default 1
        Periods to shift for forming percent change.

:param fill_method:
    str, default 'pad'
        How to handle NAs before computing percent changes.

:param limit:
    int, default None
        The number of consecutive NAs to fill before stopping.

:param freq:
    DateOffset, timedelta, or offset alias string, optional
        Increment to use from time series API (e.g. 'M' or BDay()).
        \*\*kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments are passed into
        `DataFrame.shift` or `Series.shift`.

:return: chg : Series or DataFrame
    The same type as the calling object.

Limitations
-----------
- Unsupported mixed numeric and string data
- Parameters limit, freq are currently unsupported by Intel Scalable Dataframe Compiler
- This function may reveal slower performance than Pandas\* on user system. Users should exercise a tradeoff
    between staying in JIT-region with that function or going back to interpreter mode.
