pandas.Series.map
*****************

Map values of Series according to input correspondence.

Used for substituting each value in a Series with another value,
that may be derived from a function, a ``dict`` or
a :class:`Series`.

:param arg:
    function, dict, or Series
        Mapping correspondence.

:param na_action:
    {None, 'ignore'}, default None
        If 'ignore', propagate NaN values, without passing them to the
        mapping correspondence.

:return: Series
    Same index as caller.

Limitations
-----------
- Series data types String is currently unsupported by Intel Scalable Dataframe Compiler.
- ``arg`` as Series is currently unsupported by Intel Scalable Dataframe Compiler.
- ``arg`` as function should return scalar. Other types         are currently unsupported by Intel Scalable Dataframe Compiler.
- ``na_action`` is currently unsupported by Intel Scalable Dataframe Compiler.
