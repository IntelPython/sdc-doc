pandas.Series.describe
**********************

Generate descriptive statistics that summarize the central tendency,
dispersion and shape of a dataset's distribution, excluding
``NaN`` values.

Analyzes both numeric and object series, as well
as ``DataFrame`` column sets of mixed data types. The output
will vary depending on what is provided. Refer to the notes
below for more detail.

:param percentiles:
    list-like of numbers, optional
        The percentiles to include in the output. All should
        fall between 0 and 1. The default is
        ``[.25, .5, .75]``, which returns the 25th, 50th, and
        75th percentiles.

:param include:
    'all', list-like of dtypes or None (default), optional
        A white list of data types to include in the result. Ignored
        for ``Series``. Here are the options:

        - 'all' : All columns of the input will be included in the output.
        - A list-like of dtypes : Limits the results to the
            provided data types.
            To limit the result to numeric types submit
            ``numpy.number``. To limit it instead to object columns submit
            the ``numpy.object`` data type. Strings
            can also be used in the style of
            ``select_dtypes`` (e.g. ``df.describe(include=['O'])``). To
            select pandas categorical columns, use ``'category'``
        - None (default) : The result will include all numeric columns.

:param exclude:
    list-like of dtypes or None (default), optional,
        A black list of data types to omit from the result. Ignored
        for ``Series``. Here are the options:

        - A list-like of dtypes : Excludes the provided data types
            from the result. To exclude numeric types submit
            ``numpy.number``. To exclude object columns submit the data
            type ``numpy.object``. Strings can also be used in the style of
            ``select_dtypes`` (e.g. ``df.describe(include=['O'])``). To
            exclude pandas categorical columns, use ``'category'``
        - None (default) : The result will exclude nothing.

:return: Series or DataFrame
    Summary statistics of the Series or Dataframe provided.

Limitations
-----------
- Differs from Pandas in returning statistics as Series of strings when applied to
    Series of strings or date-time values
