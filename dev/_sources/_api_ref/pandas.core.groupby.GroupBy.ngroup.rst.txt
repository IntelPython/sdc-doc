**********************************

Number each group from 0 to the number of groups - 1.

This is the enumerative complement of cumcount.  Note that the
numbers given to the groups match the order in which the groups
would be seen when iterating over the groupby object, not the
order they are first observed.

:param ascending:
    bool, default True
        If False, number in reverse, from number of group - 1 to 0.

:return: Series
    Unique numbers for each group.
