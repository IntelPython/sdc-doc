pandas.core.groupby.GroupBy.cumcount
************************************

Number each item in each group from 0 to the length of that group - 1.

Essentially this is equivalent to

>>> self.apply(lambda x: pd.Series(np.arange(len(x)), x.index))

:param ascending:
    bool, default True
        If False, number in reverse, from length of group - 1 to 0.

:return: Series
    Sequence number of each element within each group.
