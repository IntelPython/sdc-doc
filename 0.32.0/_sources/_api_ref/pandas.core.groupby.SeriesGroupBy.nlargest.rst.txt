pandas.core.groupby.SeriesGroupBy.nlargest
******************************************

Return the largest `n` elements.

:param n:
    int, default 5
        Return this many descending sorted values.

:param keep:
    {'first', 'last', 'all'}, default 'first'
        When there are duplicate values that cannot all fit in a
        Series of `n` elements:

        - ``first`` : return the first `n` occurrences in order
            of appearance.
        - ``last`` : return the last `n` occurrences in reverse
            order of appearance.
        - ``all`` : keep all occurrences. This can result in a Series of
            size larger than `n`.

:return: Series
    The `n` largest values in the Series, sorted in decreasing order.
