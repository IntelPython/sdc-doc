pandas.core.groupby.GroupBy.apply
*********************************

Apply function `func`  group-wise and combine the results together.

The function passed to `apply` must take a dataframe as its first
argument and return a DataFrame, Series or scalar. `apply` will
then take care of combining the results back together into a single
dataframe or series. `apply` is therefore a highly flexible
grouping method.

While `apply` is a very flexible method, its downside is that
using it can be quite a bit slower than using more specific methods
like `agg` or `transform`. Pandas offers a wide range of method that will
be much faster than using `apply` for their specific purposes, so try to
use them before reaching for `apply`.

:param func:
    callable
        A callable that takes a dataframe as its first argument, and
        returns a dataframe, a series or a scalar. In addition the
        callable may take positional and keyword arguments.
        args, kwargs : tuple and dict
        Optional positional and keyword arguments to pass to `func`.

:return: applied : Series or DataFrame
