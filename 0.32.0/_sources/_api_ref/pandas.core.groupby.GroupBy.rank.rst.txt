:param method:
    {'average', 'min', 'max', 'first', 'dense'}, default 'average'
        - average: average rank of group
        - min: lowest rank in group
        - max: highest rank in group
        - first: ranks assigned in order they appear in the array
        - dense: like 'min', but rank always increases by 1 between groups

:param ascending:
    boolean, default True
        False for ranks by high (1) to low (N)

:param na_option:
    {'keep', 'top', 'bottom'}, default 'keep'
       - keep: leave NA values where they are
       - top: smallest rank if ascending
       - bottom: smallest rank if descending

:param pct:
    boolean, default False
        Compute percentage rank of data within each group

:param axis:
